# BVTimeGeography
This repository contains R scripts for quantifying bird-vessel interactions with time geographic methods (probabilistic space-time prisms).

***Until manuscript publication, these scripts should only be cited or used with the author's permission, for work under the remit of the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels.***

This study was originally carried out with the following scripts in R V4.2.0 (R Core Team, 2022). To prepare for PSTP creation and interaction analysis, create a folder called “PSTP Outputs FINAL” in your chosen working directory. Within that folder, create empty folders entitled “B Subset Dataframes”, “BV PSTP Bricks”, “Interaction Bricks”, and “Summary Tables”. These folders will contain the regular trajectory CSVs for each bird and voxel size, the PSTP raster bricks for all birds and vessels, the interaction raster bricks for both VOB and DTB methods, and the summary tables of space-time cubes and interactions, respectively, after scripts 3 and 4 are run.
